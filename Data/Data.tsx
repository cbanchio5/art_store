    title: "The Rider",
    description: "A young girl in a pointed hat and skirt balances above a circling horse. She is both fragile and commanding, a figure caught between innocence and authority. The Rider is not simply guiding the animal, she is negotiating with it, embodying the eternal tension between instinct and control. The horse, a symbol of force and untamed energy, moves in endless circles, suggesting the cycles of desire and repetition that shape the unconscious.",

    title: "The Tamer",
    description: "A reclining figure in a harlequin costume extends an arm toward a leopard, poised between intimacy and danger. The Tamer is not an image of dominance but of fragile negotiation, suggesting that what is wild cannot truly be subdued, only met with presence. Behind them, the parted curtain reveals a stage both theatrical and private, inviting the viewer to wonder who is performing for whom. The Tamer embodies the paradox of mastery: to control is often to surrender.",

    title: "The Illusionist",
    description: "The Illusionist appears as a commanding female figure, her dress expanding into a stage that holds a white unicorn. She is magician and spectacle at once: her body is both performer and theater. The unicorn, elusive and mythic, represents the unattainable, the pure, the projection of dreams. In her star-marked attire and enigmatic expression, The Illusionist questions where fantasy ends and reality begins. She becomes an archetype of transformation, a figure who carries within her both deception and revelation.",
